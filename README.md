# MMC Web Code Challenge

This is a basic challenge to determine how you approach ambiguous challenges. Show us your creativity in interpreting these partial instructions to give us a working project!

## The Ask

You will need to make a small application that can search for recipes and save them to a list of favorites.

For this we'll use the free api at [Recipe Puppy](http://www.recipepuppy.com/). Documentation [can be found here.](http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/)

There are some basic mocks in `/mocks` -- showing the poor artistry of the random engineer assigned to the task.

 - Fork this project.
 - Complete the items below using any common front-end libraries only (jQuery, Lodash/Underscore).
 - Avoid front-end frameworks such as AngularJS and React, Vue, Knockout, Backbone, etc.
 - (( This must be entirely in the front end. Server side languages or platforms will be immediately disqualified ))
 - Commit this to your own git repository (any of the platforms) and send the link back. 

### What should it do?
 - Provide search functionality to query the api for recipes.
 - Show a list of recipes. Information should contain a thumbnail, recipe name, and number of ingredients.
 - Provide the functionality to add a recipe to my favorites.
 - Provide a way to get to a page showing all of my favorites.
 - Favorites should persist between page views.
 - Site should work on mobile devices.
 - Should have a very small code footprint.


#### Extra credit:
 - Add navigation that makes sense.
 - Add the ability to remove favorites.
 - Create the ability to share my favorites with others.
